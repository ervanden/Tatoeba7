How to add a language Swahili

1. In the package 'dictionaries', Create SwahiliDictionary.java from OtherDictionary.java (copy and adapt class name)

   SwahiliDictionary extends GenericDictionary which contains language-independent methods.
   OtherDictionary uses simple word lookup for the words in the dictionary file.
   To add rules that change diacritics, implement correctWordByRules(), see PortugueseDictionary.java.
   The method correctWordByRules() is only called when a word in not found in the dictionary.

note: GenericDictionary has all the methods that are used elsewhere in LanguageTrainer.
In principle the Dictionary interface should describe all these methods, so that the type
Dictionary can be used everywhere. Since this is not done (many methods that never require overriding), 
the type GenericDictionary is used throughout.

2. In the package 'languages' create Swahili.java from Other.java or from another language implementation.
   Swahili extends GenericLanguage, this is the default implementation.
   Many methods need to be overridden, see other language.java implementations.
   GenericLanguage is only useful during development to provide temporary implementations of methods.

3. Add Swahili to the static LanguageContext class. This class is used to obtain the right Language object 
   by all code that needs functions for a specific language.
   a. Add the language code to the list 'knownLanguages'.
      It will then appear in the menu of LanguageTrainerFrame.
   b. In the function 'get()' add Swahili.
