How to add a language Swahili

1. In the package 'dictionaries', Create SwahiliDictionary.java from OtherDictionary.java (copy and adapt class name)

   SwahiliDictionary extends GenericDictionary which contains language-independent methods.
   OtherDictionary uses basis word lookup for the words in the dictionary file.
   To add rules that change diacritics, see PortugueseDictionary.java.

2. In the package 'languages' create Swahili.java from Other.java or from another language implementation.
   Swahili extends GenericLanguage, this is the default implementation.
   Many methods need to be overridden, see other language.java implementations.
   GenericLanguage is only useful during development to provide temporary implementations of methods.

3. Add Swahili to the static LanguageContext class. This class is used to obtain the right Language object 
   by all code that needs functions for a specific language.
   a. The languages in the list 'knownLanguages' will appear in the menus 'Editor', 'Numbers'
   b. In the function 'get()' add Swahili.
