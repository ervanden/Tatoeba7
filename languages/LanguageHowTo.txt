How to add a language Swahili

1. In the package 'dictionaries', Create SwahiliDictionary.java from OtherDictionary.java (copy and adapt class name)

   SwahiliDictionary extends GenericDictionary which contains language-independent methods.
   Override the methods that are specific for Swahili: probably runDictionaryOnWord().
   If nothing else is required than substitute words from the dictionary 'words' list, 
   then runDictionaryOnWord from GenericDictionary can be used, it does exactly this.

2. In the package 'languages' create Swahili.java from Other.java (copy and adapt class name)
   Swahili extends GenericLanguage, this is the default implementation.
   But normally all methods have to be overridden.

3. Add Swahili to the static LanguageContext class. This class is used to obtain the right Language object 
   by all code that needs functions for a specific language.
   a. The languages in the list 'knownLanguages' will appear in the menus 'Editor', 'Numbers'
   b. In the function 'get()' add Swahili.
